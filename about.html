From humble beginnings as “Brad’s Drink,” created by Caleb Bradham in New Bern, North Carolina, to its position as a global leader in the beverage industry, Pepsi has continued to evolve and innovate in ways that resonate with its consumers.

 cultural significance, with both brands competing for the hearts, minds, and wallets of millions. Pepsi’s ability to adapt to changing tastes,
  introduce new flavors, and align itself with pop culture and major global events has kept it relevant in a rapidly changing world.
